### Description
A lot of times, when I want to jot down thoughts and give myself a timer, I use a note-taking app on one tab and then a timer on another tab. Many times, I either get shocked by the loud beeping noise from the timer or I find myself circulating around the thoughts that I've already written down or I lose stickies. Quickie Stickies combines both features into one app. With a user-friendly and accessibility-friendly interface, it has 3 sections:

1. Timer - There is a countdown time paired with two buttons: start and reset buttons. You can edit the countdown by clicking on the numbers and then hit start when you're ready. Once the timer reaches 0, you get some confetti on the screen!
2. Note actions - There is an input bar for all the new notes and two buttons where you have the choice to hide notes and to export notes to a .txt file for storing the notes in a more permanent location
3. Notes - All your notes live here where you can edit them by clicking on the note. If you don't like the note, you can delete them.

### FAQ
#### Is it accessibility-friendly?
I tried my best to make sure that it is keyboard-friendly and has focus and visual cues around interactive elements. Colour contrast could be improved though.

#### What's the point of hiding notes?
Sometimes, you can get influenced by the thoughts you wrote down already so to avoid this, you can choose to hide notes which will make the note section blurry. That way, you can freely keep adding notes until you're done!

#### How do you remove notes?
If you remove the content in a note and hit Backspace/Delete again, the note will be deleted.

#### Who is this app for?
This app is for people looking to do brainstorming sessions quickly whether it's for personal use or for workshops. I find that it can be a bit annoying to have 2 different tabs open for this kind of work so I thought to put it into one place for people like me.

#### What languages did you use?
Just good ol' JavaScript. I kept it basic as I wanted to work on my front-end skills.

#### Where did you get the confetti from??
There's this cool npm package (but also available as a CDN) called [canvas-confetti](https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti). Definitely worth checking out!

#### What are some improvements you wanted to add in?
A whole bunch! For starters, here are just some I wanted to add:
- copying notes to clipboard on top of being able to download as a .txt file
- selecting specific notes (more than one) and copy to clipboard or export to .txt file
- expanding the input bar height if text overflows past the input bar width
- copying the entire functionality of the timer online when you google "timer online"
- having sound as an option to be played when the countdown time reaches 0
- perhaps having a database and choice to login and save your stored notes
